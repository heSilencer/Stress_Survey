            <p>Greetings User</p>
            <p>You are invited to participate in our student stress survey.
                 We know that higher education experience can be truly genuinely
                  stressful sometimes, and we want to find out ways to support our students
                  to cope with that more efficiently.</p>

            <p> The purpose of this questionnaire is to capture feedback about the stress 
                you've experienced this academic year and how you've handled that. The completion 
                will take approximately 5-10 minutes.</p>

            <p>Please, take some moments to reflect on each question addressed and try to be as sincere as possible.
                 Your answers will remain confidential and they will be only used in finding ways
                  to improve the academic experience of our students in the future..</p>

            <p>You can start with the survey by checking the Box and clicking on the agree button below. Thank you for your cooperation!.</p>

                <label for="agree-checkbox">

                event.preventDefault(); // Prevent form submission if checkbox is not checked
